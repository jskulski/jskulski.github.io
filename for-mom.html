Hi Mom!

Happy Mother's Day! Thinking of you, and can't wait to see you next. I love you, you've done so much for me and us and our family. I am so deeply grateful.

I found a poem last month. If you could do me a gift this Mother's Day (yes a favor, for me, on your day!), when you have a quiet night and some time to reflect (and maybe after a good meal) listen to this poem:

As poets do, they say things better than anyone every could.

Love,
Jon
