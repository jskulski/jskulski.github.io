Hi Mom!

Happy Mother's Day! Thinking of you, and can't wait to see you next. I love you, you've done so much for me and us and our family. I am so deeply grateful.

I found this poem last month. If you could do me a gift(!) this Mother's Day (*yes a favor, for me, on your day!*), when you have a quiet night and some time to reflect (*and maybe after a good meal*), listen to this poem.

As poets do, they say things better than anyone ever could.

Love,
